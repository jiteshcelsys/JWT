#  JWT using Sql database(frontend/backend)

In this project I am storing the data in the database and from their based on correct credential allowing the user to use the website.
And if the user is not available we can add the user by sigup and after that he/she can login with that credentials to visit our website




## Tools Required
● VS code

● React

● react-router-dom

● Node js

● Express js



## Features
● On clicking the signup button a dialog box will pop up and after providing
the details the data will be stored in the database

● On clicking the login button a dialog box will popup
 where we have to provide the  correct credential to visit the 
 website

 ● If the credential was not correct it will render the /404 error page.



## Learning

● How To connect the database with the frontend.

● I have used various packages that
 are necessary (cors, express,jsonwentoken,bcrypt,Node.js);
